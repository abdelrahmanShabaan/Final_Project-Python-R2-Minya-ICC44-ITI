            You may not use any ELDash Service if you are the subject of U.S.
            sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the
            governments of the country where you are using ELDash Services. You

            you to act in any manner (including taking or failing to take any
            actions in connection with a transaction) which is inconsistent with

          <h2>OTHER BUSINESS</h2>
          <p>
            Parties other than ELDash operate stores, provide services, or sell
            product lines on this Website. In addition, we provide links to the
            sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. We are
            not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant
            the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals or the
            content of their websites. ELDash does not assume any responsibility
            or liability for the actions, product, and content of all of these
            or any other third parties. When a third party is involved in your
            transactions, we may share your information related to those
            transactions with that third party. You should carefully review
            their privacy statements and other conditions of use.

        <li>
          <h2>ELDash'S ROLE</h2>
          <p>
            ELDash allows third party sellers to list and sell their products at
            ELDash.eg. In each such case this is indicated on the respective
            product detail page. While ELDash helps facilitate transactions that
            are carried out on the ELDash marketplace, ELDash is neither the
            buyer nor the seller of the seller’s items. ELDash provides a venue
            for sellers and buyers to negotiate and complete transactions.
            Accordingly, the contract formed at the completion of a sale for
            these third party products is solely between buyer and seller.
            ELDash is not a party to this contract nor assumes any
            responsibility arising out of or in connection with it nor is it the
            seller’s agent. The seller is responsible for the sale of the
            products and for dealing with any buyer claims or any other issue
            arising out of or in connection with the contract between the buyer
            and seller. Because ELDash wants the buyer to have a safer buying
            experience, ELDash provides the ELDash A-to-z guarantee in addition
            to any contractual or other rights.

          <h2>OUR LIABILITY</h2>
          <p>
            We will do our utmost to ensure that availability of the ELDash
            Services will be uninterrupted and that transmissions will be
            error-free. However, due to the nature of the internet, this cannot
            be guaranteed. Also, your access to ELDash Services may also be
            occasionally suspended or restricted to allow for repairs,
            maintenance, or the introduction of new facilities or services. We
            will attempt to limit the frequency and duration of any such
            suspension or restriction. ELDash will not be responsible for (i)
            losses that were not caused by any breach on our part, or (ii) any
            business loss (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts,
            anticipated savings, data, goodwill or wasted expenditure), or (iii)
            any indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to
            both you and us when you commenced using the ELDash Services. We
            will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with
            our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure
            arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control. This
            condition does not affect your legal right to have goods sent or
            services provided within a reasonable time or to receive a refund if
            goods or services ordered cannot be supplied within a reasonable
            time owing to a cause beyond our reasonable control.

            obligations arising out of or in connection with them (for the
            purpose of this section, a “Dispute”). Egyptian courts shall have
            exclusive jurisdiction to settle such Dispute and each party submits
            to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Arab Republic of
            Egypt. For the purposes of this section, you waive any objection to
            the Egyptian courts, on the grounds that it is an inconvenient or
            inappropriate forum to settle any Dispute.
